# Route definitions for the anytown module.

# Each route needs a unique identifier. We recommend prefixing the route with the name of your module. Indented under the route name is the definition of the route. A routing.yml file can contain any number of routes.

anytown.weather_page:
  # The URL path where this page will be displayed. { style } represents a placeholder and will be populated by whatever is entered into that position of the URL. A routing.yml file can contain any number of routes. The result should be a path of /weather/extended or weather/short
  path: '/weather/{style}'
  defaults: 
    # Title of the page used for things like the <title> tag.
    _title: 'Weather at the Anytown Farmers Market'
    # Defines which method, or which class, should be called to retrieve the content of the page.
    _controller: '\Drupal\anytown\Controller\WeatherPage::build'
    # /weather URL path default if { style } is not present
    style: 'short'
  requirements:
    # What permissions a user needs to have in order to view this page. It's supposed to match the initial key on the anytown.permissions.yml file
    _permission: 'view weekly weather'

#Settings form route.
anytown.settings:
  path: '/admin/config/system/anytown'
  defaults:
    _title: 'Anytown Settings'
    #For form controllers use _form instead of _controller. This tells Drupal to use the build, validate, submit workflow for a form.
    _form: 'Drupal\anytown\Form\SettingsForm'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'administer site configuration'
